The goal of this project is to achieve 80% accuracy in the prediction of high-traffic recipes and to minimize the prediction non high-traffic ones.

Here you will be able to find two files, one containing the data called recipe_site_traffic_2212.csv and one containing the Jupyter Notebook.

In this project, we go through three steps:
1. Clean the data and prepare for our machine learning model.
2. Data Analysis of our data to gain a better understanding of our data and the features we will implement in our model.
3. Created a machine-learning model to achieve the desired goal of predicting high-traffic recipes 80% of the time so we can put them forward on the company's website.


We concluded this project with some benchmarks to monitor in the future and some business advice specific to this problem.
